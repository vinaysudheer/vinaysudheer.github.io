This is Vinay - a security researcher, sometimes builder, and occasional breaker of things. I like philosophy, staying active and exploring the deeper values of life.

This blog is where I share notes from the field - research, experiments, projects, my thoughts, life experiences, and sometimes just things I wish I had found on Google sooner.
